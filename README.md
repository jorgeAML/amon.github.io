The Amon theme is just another project from Jorge AML using bootstrap, as you can see in the link above or here: [Amon theme](https://jorgeaml.github.io/amon.github.io/) I change a lot of colours and environment of the basic template of bootstrap because the Amon theme it's thinking to use in the night. 
Right now I am gonna explain what changes I did in this new theme: 
all the new styles are in css/theme-aml/asphalt.css
1. navs 
the new style of the navs has a new style that is a background, border-bottom and a box-shadow. you need to know what changes are: 
``` 
*background-colour: #1a2636;*
 *border-bottom: 4px solid #2a4d69;*
 *box-shadow: 0px 1px 1px 1px #0e1a40;*
